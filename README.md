## UX 
My goal in the design was to make it minimalist as possible for information on personal trainer at best interest.
i want client able to read the contents with ease and interest them to learn and improvised themself.
I want client able to navigate and book a session with ease of use, at anytime, mobile based by using calendar 
sychonised between Michael and clients based members on this website.

minimalist colour black and white for background image display,
orange and blue for logo and button display.

## Techology use.
For this project, as strictly only in

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (with updated version.)

## features

I want able to add alert banner for adverts discounts, at the top of webpage.

I want a webpage for scrolling down, and a modal for members page and booking area.

I will add forms for client's details to become a member.
so members able to book a session with Michael, 
and ease of use by planning through a sychonised calendar on Michael's organised calendar.

I would like a calendar in different booking colors for Michael so he will know which area of sport.

I would like to keep it minimized in mobile forms, such as carousals that shalt be restricted.
