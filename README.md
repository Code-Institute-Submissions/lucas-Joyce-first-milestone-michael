-------------------------------------------------------------------
## Strategy
My goal in the design was to make it easy as possible to able navigate and access for booking a session with the ease of use, at anytime, and in a mobile based version by using calendar login, sychonised it between Michael and clients based members on this website, with an option to contact Michael if they choose.
### Scope
For clients, Michael wanted to providing them a clear aim for their fitness goals and his capabilities to provide them as best as he can with the expertise in knowledge of sports and physical health capabilities.
### Structure
In the experience section, I'd like them to see the action of what he does and what he do, also 
in the service section, I want client to be able to quick read and visualised of what to expect from Michael, in simple sentence and visualised pictures.

### Surface
The greyscale colour was chosen for background to keep it away from distraction to the actual focuse on the contents,
Coral orange and pale blue for display of buttons and borders, a clear target of where the buttons are, beside it's because Michael's favorite colour, so that's the theme.
# Techologies
For this project, as strictly only in
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (with updated version.)
# Features 
I would like to keep it minimized in mobile media contents, such as carousals that will not be displayed.
On the first Index page, "sign up" was important, to get the clients to add the email address, sooner the possible, the better chance for Michael to acquire new customers.

In the service section, It would be better to minimalised the overloading of the infomations, so the icons will to be clicked onto for a choosen specfic details, in modal forms.

## Features left to implement 
To have the navigation menu with an extra javascript function added to create a smooth scrolling effect and collapsed menu to stay collapsed.

In the service section I'd like to implement a "Ashion style" box selector in "my portfilo" seen [here](http://www.chitrakootweb.com/template/ashton/home07-light-side-nav.html#portfolio)

In the Booking section, a blue button that shown "Sign in" will only appear at the start, no calendar nor user/setting icons to be shown.
When sign in and the button will also transformed into "sign out" ready, and will have a timer of inactive idle (just above the sign-out button) to countdown and automatically signed out.

Radio buttons, time, and the date, will appear in coloured ticked icon, based on once user have filled in, email and thumb up will also become green when all requirment is meet and approved.

I will add further forms for client's details to become a member.
so members able to book a session with Michael, 

I would like a calendar in different booking colors for Michael so he will know which area of sport and anything that is booked shalt be greyed out to members's calendar page and to sychonised it to Michael's calendar, much of this is related in Javascripts.

## Testing 
The customer and client also the employer user story achieved the intended outcome of providing them with a showcase of myself and my skill. In the about me section, they can read a bit about my background, and if they're viewing on a desktop, and the big screen mobile phone at landscape orientation, the background of this section is a photo of me. 

In the experience section, the intended outcome to show that it is more than just skills, hence the title experience, to use the modal form to click on, to illustrate the visual happy pictures, to show postiveness to the potental new customers in all forms of media devices, however i realised not all will work in "Modal" height issue, 
such as  ```max-height:-webkit-fill-available;``` nor ``fit-content``,
and to prevent overflow unwanted scroll, restricted to **90vh** and ```max-width:max-content;```.

See to [modalTest.html](https://github.com/lucas-Joyce/first-milestone-michael/blob/modalTest.html)

If an customer or client is interested in contacting me, they will have to fill out all fields in order for the form to go through.

## Deployment

This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named `index.html`.
